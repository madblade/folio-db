An important bottleneck to the technique is the high CPU load necessary to extract the shadow geometry (as well as the burden put on the fill rate during rasterization). When the shadow caster is sufficiently smooth, however, this geometry extraction becomes trivial—and the shadowing artifacts are kept to a minimum. This is an illustration with some smooth meshes (and a skinned character):"},{"type":2,"content":"<a href=\"https://madblade.github.io/shadow-volume/\">Demo</a>"},{"type":2,"content":"<a href=\"https://github.com/madblade/shadow-volume/\">Source code</a>"}],"type":"craft","id":10010}
